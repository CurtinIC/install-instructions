# Python

[Python](http://python.org) is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be a bit difficult, so we recommend [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda), an all-in-one installer.

Regardless of how you choose to install it, **please make sure you install Python version 3.x** (e.g., 3.4 is fine).

We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all [supported](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility) (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).

## Windows

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQ0mzZ8UvA)

1.  Open [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads) with your web browser.
2.  Download the Python 3 installer for Windows.
3.  Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation _except_ make sure to check **Make Anaconda the default Python**.

## Mac OS X

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcSAln46u9U)

1.  Open [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads) with your web browser.
2.  Download the Python 3 installer for OS X.
3.  Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

## Linux

1.  Open [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads) with your web browser.
2.  Download the Python 3 installer for Linux.
3.  Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation. (Installation requires using the shell. If you aren't comfortable doing the installation yourself stop here and request help at the workshop.)
4.  Open a terminal window.
5.  Type

    <pre>bash Anaconda3-</pre>

    and then press tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.
6.  Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the screen press the down arrow to move down through the text. Type `yes` and press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the default location for the files. Type `yes` and press enter to prepend Anaconda to your `PATH` (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).
